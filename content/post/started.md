You have heard peoples talking about machine learning. But your understaning about __ML__ may not be clear after reading the wikipedia article. You are tired of nodding your head through conversations.
Lets change it.
### What is machine learning?
Machine learing is an algorithm which learns from experience instead of hard coded rules. Instead of writting code for every rules you will feed data to the generic algorithm(classifier) and it will build own logic from the supplied data.
